# health_search_data

This is the Google Search interest data, which powers the Visualization Searching For Health. The data set was made available by Google News Lab on Kaggle. With this data, we are going to explore the search trends of people for common health issues in the United States.

What I expect to see in this data set is a constant increase of the amount of searches done each year and that the states/regions that are considered to be sicker would have more searches done, while the healthier states/regions would have less searches regarding the health issues in this data set. We will take a look at these trends and the relationships between the searched health issues.
